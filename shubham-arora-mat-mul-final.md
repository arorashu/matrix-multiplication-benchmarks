# Naive Matrix multiplication

For two matrices of size n x n

Time complexity: O(n^3)

---

# Strassens's Method of Matrix Multiplication

## Key insight
 - Multiplication is computationally more expensive than addition
 - Utilise Dynamic programming 


---
# Preparation for Dynamic programming
Let us break down the problem into subparts as:

# Naive Algorithm

Now, the standard algorithm does the follows:

i.e. 8 multiplications, 4 Additions


---

# Strassens's Algorithm

Strassen's algorithm does a neat trick: 

![](strassen-mat-break-1.jpg) ![](strassen-mat-break-2.jpg)

i.e. **7 multiplications**, 18 Additions

# Strassen Algorithm

For two matrices of size n x n

Time complexity: O(n^lg(7)) = O(n^2.81)

# Some notes

 - Current fastest algorithms has performance : 
 - However, they have  a very large overhead, and not used currently in practice
 - The lower bound on Matrix Multiplication is proved to be: O(n^2)
